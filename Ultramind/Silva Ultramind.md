## Mastering Posture and Style

Day one.

### The Short Relaxation Exercise

It's the typical relaxation meditation exercise. Feel different parts of your body, imagine yourself in a calm place. The third part was not clear, I have trouble understanding Vishen's accent. Overall it was nice, but not thrilling.

## Tap Into Alpha With The Centring Excercise

Day two.

### Your Daily Practice - Going to your Center

We recommend that you practice going to your center (also known as your ‘level’) 1 to 3 times every day. Do this by using the 3-2-1 Technique for a minimum of 5 minutes each time. When you reach your level, you can either relax at that state, or continue with any techniques you learn. Come out of your center by counting out 1-to-5 at the end. You can go to your center up to 3 times everyday. 

Gong to your center can be as short as 5 minutes. So 5 minutes minimum, 3 times a day adds up to 15 minutes a day only.  
  
**Note**: If there's a Centering or Projection exercise on a day (such as in this lesson), _that_ exercise counts as one practice session - meaning that you could choose to practice going to your center (using the 3-2-1 technique) 1 or 2 more times today if you want to aim for 2-3 times a day. **_You do not need to do the Centering Exercise more than once a day._**
